## Executive Summary

ComponentCraft AI is a specialized Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that helps Drupal developers quickly generate U.S. Web Design System (USWDS) compliant components from Figma designs. By focusing specifically on the intersection of USWDS and Drupal, ComponentCraft AI addresses a critical pain point for government website developers: the repetitive, time-consuming process of rebuilding the same components across different projects.

Our solution leverages AI to analyze Figma designs, match them to USWDS patterns, and generate production-ready Drupal code with proper integration. By providing specialized templates and implementation patterns, ComponentCraft AI significantly reduces development time, ensures compliance with government standards, and improves code quality.

The business operates on a subscription model with tiered pricing based on usage, targeting Drupal developers working on government websites, web agencies with government contracts, and government IT departments.

## Problem Statement

### Core Problems

1. **Repetitive Component Rebuilding**: Drupal developers working on government websites must repeatedly rebuild the same USWDS components for each new project, wasting time and resources.

2. **Compliance Challenges**: Ensuring components meet USWDS specifications and accessibility requirements is complex and error-prone.

3. **Design-to-Code Gap**: Translating Figma designs to USWDS-compliant Drupal components requires specialized knowledge of both systems.

4. **Integration Complexity**: Different Drupal implementation approaches (blocks, views, paragraphs) require different code patterns.

    style E fill:#e06666,stroke:#990000,color:#ffffff
```

### Quantified Problem

- **Time Cost**: Developers spend 4-8 hours per component on implementation
- **Project Impact**: Average government site uses 15-20 USWDS components
- **Financial Impact**: At $100/hour developer rate, component development costs $6,000-16,000 per project
- **Quality Issues**: 30% of government sites fail accessibility compliance on first audit

## Solution Overview

ComponentCraft AI is a specialized MCP server that integrates with AI coding assistants like Cline to provide USWDS component generation capabilities for Drupal developers.

### Key Features

1. **Figma Design Analysis**: Extract design tokens and identify USWDS patterns from Figma designs
2. **Component Template Library**: Comprehensive library of USWDS components with Drupal integration

```

### Security & Licensing

To protect our intellectual property while allowing local execution, we'll implement:

1. **Split Functionality Architecture**: Core templates and AI models in the cloud, interface on local machine
2. **License Token System**: Secure JWT-based tokens with regular validation
3. **Usage Tracking**: Monitor component generation for billing
4. **Offline Capabilities**: Limited offline usage with synchronization

## User Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Individual Developer with Figma Design

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Dev as Developer
    participant Cline as Cline AI
    participant MCP as ComponentCraft MCP
    participant Figma as Figma MCP

    Dev->>Cline: "Create USWDS accordion with table from this Figma design"
    Cline->>MCP: Request component with Figma URL
    MCP->>Figma: Extract design data
    Figma->>MCP: Return design elements
    MCP->>MCP: Analyze for USWDS patterns
    MCP->>Cline: Ask implementation preferences
    Cline->>Dev: "How would you like to implement this component?"
    Dev->>Cline: "As a Drupal block"
    Cline->>MCP: Request block implementation
    MCP->>MCP: Generate component code
    MCP->>Cline: Return complete component
    Cline->>Dev: Present final code
```

**Before ComponentCraft AI:**
- Developer spends 6 hours manually coding the component
- Needs to research USWDS specifications
- Must test for accessibility compliance
- Has to implement Drupal integration patterns

**After ComponentCraft AI:**
- Complete component generated in 15 minutes
- USWDS compliance guaranteed
- Accessibility built-in
- Drupal integration handled automatically

### Scenario 2: Agency Team Building Government Site

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant PM as Project Manager
    participant Dev as Developer
    participant Cline as Cline AI
    participant MCP as ComponentCraft MCP

    PM->>Dev: "We need these 15 USWDS components for the DOE site"
    Dev->>Cline: "Create USWDS hero component for DOE site"
    Cline->>MCP: Request component template
    MCP->>Cline: Provide implementation options
    Cline->>Dev: Present options and ask preferences
    Dev->>Cline: Select preferences
    Cline->>MCP: Request customized component
    MCP->>Cline: Return component code
    Cline->>Dev: Present component code
    Dev->>PM: "Component ready for review"
```

**ROI Calculation:**
- 15 components Ã— 6 hours each = 90 hours of development time
- 90 hours Ã— $100/hour = $9,000 cost
- With ComponentCraft AI: 15 components Ã— 30 minutes = 7.5 hours
- 7.5 hours Ã— $100/hour = $750 cost
- **Savings: $8,250 (92% reduction)**

### Scenario 3: Government IT Department with Existing Theme

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant IT as IT Director
    participant Dev as Developer
    participant Cline as Cline AI
    participant MCP as ComponentCraft MCP

    IT->>Dev: "Add these components to our site with our agency theme"
    Dev->>Cline: "Create USWDS components matching our theme"
    Cline->>MCP: Request theme analysis
    MCP->>MCP: Analyze existing theme
    MCP->>Cline: Provide theme integration options
    Cline->>Dev: Present options
    Dev->>Cline: Select theme integration approach
    Cline->>MCP: Request themed components
    MCP->>Cline: Return themed component code
    Cline->>Dev: Present final code
    Dev->>IT: "Components integrated with our theme"
```

**Value Proposition:**
- Consistent branding across components
- Maintains agency design system
- Reduces theme integration time by 80%
